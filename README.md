- 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Ahsen
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking and to be more precise, I am interested in Penetration Testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ethical Hacking for The Cyber Mentor. I was learning something else for sometime so I could meet my expenses as I am a student but I am back and have resumed the course. 
- 📫 You can contact me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliahsenofficial/ or you can email me at aliahsenofficial@gmail.com 

I have expertise in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking. I have been studying Computer Security-related stuff for about 4 years and have good knowledge about this field. I also have been working on my own to test my skills and did many small side projects. I have also been learning many other expects of Computer Science which includes Web Development for Web Penetration, SQL, and MongoDB for databases.
